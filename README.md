# Introduction
This project, named Zenith Compiler, is a C language compiler currently under development. It incorporates lexer, parser, and intermediate code generation stages. It’s built on a custom grammar by the project author, inspired by Jeff Lee’s ANSI C grammar. The formal grammar specification is available in GRAMMAR.md.

# File structure
Overview of the project’s directory layout, detailing how source code, headers, data, and scripts are structured.

- `headers/`: Header files (`.h`) for the compiler modules.
- `sources/`: Source code files (`.c`) implementing compiler functionality.  
- `data/`  
  - `input/`: Input source files for compilation.
  - `output/`: Output files generated by the compiler.
- `scripts/`: Build and run scripts for different platforms.

# Build
On Windows, to build the project, run:
```bat
./scripts/build_on_windows.bat
```

If the build is successful, you will see the message:
```bat
Build successful.
```

Otherwise, if the build fails, you will see:
```bat
Build failed.
```

Note: Ensure that `gcc` is installed and available in your system's PATH environment variable.

# Run
On Windows, to execute the compiler, run:
```bat
./scripts/run_on_windows.bat
```

<br>



# Usage
The compiler expects two command-line arguments:

```bat
<compiler_executable> <input_source_file> <output_file>
```
